# Run script by typing: run.pl

# This script runs on student.  If you run it on other machines,
# you may need to make changes to it to get it to work.
#
# The script assumes that the name of the executable is tomasulo
# and the input file is a command line argument. The output
# is sent to standard out.
# You will need to change the script, if this isn't the how to execute
# your code.
#
# If your program fails on an input file, then the input file, the
# output produced by your program on that input file, and a file 
# containing the differences between the output and the expected output
# are placed in your Tests directory.  If your program doesn't produce
# an output file for a particular input, then the input file alone
# is placed the Tests directory.  If your program passes all tests, then
# the Tests directory should be empty after running the script.
