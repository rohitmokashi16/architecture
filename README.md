# Architecture Work

### What this is
This is a colloboration between Taylor Norris and I, completing the work for Dr. Norris' Computer Architecture class.

### Plans for the course
Through this course we will be tasked with writing a DLX assembler in the language of our choice. I would like to potentially write the assembler in Clojure as I think Lisp would make this easy. The remainder of the class will be spent developing an emulator for our machine. It is likely this will be done in C++
